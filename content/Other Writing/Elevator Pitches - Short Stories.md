# Death by Bucket

A hopefully humorous short story about a result-oriented, if-it-ain't-broke student whose zealous professor demands creativity for his final assignment. Oh, and they're assassins. Read [[Death by Bucket|here]].

(This was inspired by an old Twitter post of the author Brandon Sanderson, in which he suggested writing a short story entirely through dialogue as a writing exercise.)

# The Failed Hero

I wrote this one mainly to try and get a better feel of some character and worldbuilding ideas that I had. It's not much of a _story_ per se, but more an attempt to showcase some characters and a world. The scene follows a girl undertaking a standard test which is more of a rite of passage given how scary and potentially dangerous it is. Read [[The Failed Hero|here]].

# William Shakespeare x J.K. Rowling - Harry Potter and the Stone of Sorcery

What if William Shakespeare and J.K. Rowling collaborated on Harry Potter? This is my attempt at imagining what the beginning of such a collaboration could look like. This is a rewrite of the first one and a quarter chapters of _Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone_ in Shakespearean English. Read [[The Stone of Sorcery|here]].
